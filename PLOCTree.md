# PLOCTree
A Fast, High-Quality Hardware BVH Builder

---

## Background

---

### Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH)

<!-- What is the current problem? -->

---

#### BHV construction approaches:

1. **insertion** (incremental)
2. **subdivison** (top-down)
3. **agglomeration** (bottom-up)

<!-- bla bla -->

---

### Surface Area Heuristic (SAH)

<!-- -->

---

## PLOC

---

### Morton Order

<!-- quick explanation for those who don't know -->

---


### Parallel Locality Ordered Clustering (PLOC)

PLOC is a massively parallel, agglomerative BHV construction algorithm

It orders clusters in **Morton Order** to allow for efficient neighboring distance approximate computation
